Part 38 of the 100 days of code Bootcamp:
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The aim of the project:
- Practice using different APIs by POST and GET methods
- Create an application that takes input from the user about his recent exercises and duration
- Input is converted from natural language to dataframe, and the number of calories burned is added.
- Information is passed to the Sheety.com service API, which keeps it as a google spreadsheet in a database format.

## Features


## How to run

 - Run main.py file
 - Variables are needed to use the APIs. The full list of needed variables is located at the top of the 
main.py file. My variables were hidden in a credentials.py file which is not attached for obvious reasons.
## Library

- python 3.8.10
- requests
