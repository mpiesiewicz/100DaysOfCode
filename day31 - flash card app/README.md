The aim of the project:
- Create Flashy - a language learning app 
Helps to learn new words. Draw a card. If the word on the card is known, press âœ”
to add it to known words and remove from the deck. If not, 
see the english side and add the word back to the deck.


## Features

- Nice and simple GUI
- Saves the progress in data/words_to_learn csv file
- Contains the most used words in the selected language, 
based on opensubtitles.org database (credits: https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/tree/master/content/2018)

Why is it better than the original one?
- 2 Languages support instead of one - French and Spanish
- 8000 words to learn per language 
- Reset words or choose how many to fetch using reset button
- Built in menu bar with options to change language, reset or quit the app
- The popularity rank of the word is shown on the bottom right corner of the card.
